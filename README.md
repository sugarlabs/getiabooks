Get Internet Archive Books

An Activity for the One Laptop Per Child project which allows you to search through the Internet Archive collection
of free e-books and download the ones you want to your Journal in the format you want. Your Journal entry will 
be given a meaningful name. This is a much faster and easier way to get books than using the archive.org website
would be.

Note that some books in the Internet Archive are not available for download. These will have the word "encrypted"
in the file name, and the Read Activity will not be able to open them.
